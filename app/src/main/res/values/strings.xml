    <string name="why_rural_invest_info">
        Rural invest is an initiative by Tarrakki.com along with 4 promising young entrepreneurs - Satyam, Naman, Raghav &amp; Madhav.
        \n\n
        Today, India has the world’s largest rural population, which is yet to be tapped to its
        fullest potential. There exists a pertinent lack of financial planning in rural Indian
        households. According to a recent survey conducted by SEBI, less than 1% of rural
        people invest in financial instruments. Out of 13,697 respondents, only 35 have some
        formal financial investments, which is a mere 0.23%. Thus, financial literacy is a big
        challenge for the rural population in India; however, it also plays a crucial role in the
        economy’s prospects.
        \n\n
        We intend to inculcate a habit of saving in our country’s rural population so that they
        can make financially informed goal-oriented decisions towards securing a better
        future for themselves &amp; their family. It is because the financial situation and behavior
        of rural households not only affects their livelihood; it also has a significant influence
        on the stability of the financial system and future economic growth of the country.
        \n\n
        However, the behavior of rural household investors regarding saving &amp; investment
        behavior is inconsistent and unpredictable because of the lack of financial education,
        impoverished lifestyle, unstable occupation, and fluctuating income. They are not
        able to save their money due to these irregularities, and even if some households
        save, it is usually informal savings in the form of cash, which might pose liquidity
        challenges during unexpected situations like Demonetization or COVID-19. Lack of
        awareness about ways &amp; benefits of investing in financial assets leads to an increase
        in informal savings &amp; investments, which ultimately does not contribute to the capital
        formation of the country.
        \n\n
        Thus, we decided to start Rural Invest, an initiative like Rural Invest which is the
        need of the hour to leverage finance’s power to empower and tap the untapped Indian
        rural market. Rural Invest aims to spread awareness about financial literacy amongst
        rural households &amp; inculcate the habit of saving &amp; investing. Thus, Rural Invest is
        an effective avenue for Rural India for saving, borrowing, investing, and mitigating
        future financial risks, thereby also ensuring access to liquidity in times of distress.

        Before opting for an investment strategy, rethink your priorities as practi-cally as possible.
        \n\nIf you are investing in order to grow your money significantly in the long run, you may need to have a higher exposure to direct equity (stocks). This would require you to opt for an Aggressive or Moderate Investment Strategy. This also means that you may see the value of your portfolio go down, based on market conditions. The key to grow your money is to not get sentimental when markets dip, because markets that dip, inevitably rise again.
        \n\nIf the safety of your invested money and capital protection in the near future is very important to you, you might want to opt for a Conservative Investment Strategy. While your money will grow very slowly with this strategy, it will also be less likely to see major ups and downs irrespective of market conditions.

        In the last 25 years, markets have gone through many ups and downs. They have fallen and recovered multiple times.
        \n\n
        But, in the long run, those who remained invested through the ups and downs have emerged as multi-millionaires.
        \n\n
        Those who redeemed or stopped their investments because of market dips, simply missed the bus.
